## design philosophy

David Ploog (a former DCSS developer) [wrote](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/03/23/making-dungeon-crawl-stone-soup-with-253-cooks-and-no-head-chef/): 
> In NetHack they have this model where if somebody [on the team] objects to something, it will not happen. So every person can veto every change. And in the end you could see that NetHack was dead, much less from having no releases – even when they had a few releases the changes that would appear were miniscule. Minor and minor. And they did improve, but they wouldn’t do anything radical. I was very much afraid that in Crawl, something like this could happen.

bcrawl exists because I believe DCSS has become stagnant, generally [unwilling](https://www.reddit.com/r/dcss/comments/9aseh1/has_dcss_development_stagnated/e4yty2n/) to try new content.

bcrawl is meant to be for all players, not just long-time players who adopted certain canonized strategies. Neither will bcrawl be [changed](https://www.reddit.com/r/dcss/comments/8poib2/make_lees_rapid_deconstruction_never_break_walls/) to prevent strategies *just* because they violate developer preconceptions about how to play. Instead, the guiding principle of bcrawl is that fun and fair things are good, and unfun and unfair things are bad.

This is why bcrawl exists. I hope that it can meet those goals; for now, I (bhauth) think it is.
