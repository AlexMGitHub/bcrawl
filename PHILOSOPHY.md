## design philosophy

#### experimentation is necessary

David Ploog (a former DCSS developer) [wrote](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/03/23/making-dungeon-crawl-stone-soup-with-253-cooks-and-no-head-chef/): 
> In NetHack they have this model where if somebody [on the team] objects to something, it will not happen. So every person can veto every change. And in the end you could see that NetHack was dead, much less from having no releases – even when they had a few releases the changes that would appear were miniscule. Minor and minor. And they did improve, but they wouldn’t do anything radical. I was very much afraid that in Crawl, something like this could happen.

When I started bcrawl, I felt that DCSS had become stagnant, generally [unwilling](https://www.reddit.com/r/dcss/comments/9aseh1/has_dcss_development_stagnated/e4yty2n/) to try adding new content.

More recently, there have been a number of changes, almost entirely coming from a single new developer. But while I like to see new things being tried, I now feel that there's a lack of:
- discussion of and collaboration on design of gameplay changes
- adequate testing before gameplay changes are made
- willingness to revert problematic gameplay changes

While bcrawl does not use actual votes on changes like X-Crawl did, changes still involve community suggestions and feedback.

#### supporting more gameplay styles is good

Having more ways to play a game is good, if they are fun for at least some players and reasonably well-balanced. Variety provides both more replay value and wider appeal.

So, bcrawl will not be [changed](https://www.reddit.com/r/dcss/comments/8poib2/make_lees_rapid_deconstruction_never_break_walls/) to prevent strategies *just* because they violate developer preconceptions about how to play. Instead, the strength and entertainment values of tactics and strategies will be evaluated as they exist in practice.

Also, optional content such as species and usable items will generally only be removed if it is unfair, redundant, misleading, or useless. Content will not be removed just for being unnecessary to certain "canonical" strategies.

#### design ideology should be tested

Changes should be evaluated based on their effect in practice, not based on what they "should" do according to some design ideology.

#### games have many goals that must be balanced against each other

According to the philosophy bcrawl follows, strategic depth, minimizing tedium, variety, replayability, flavor, narrative, intuitiveness, and visuals all have some value in games. (Some designers follow an ideology that ignores some of those, or values one infinitely more than the others, but I believe that leads to games that are incomplete and unbalanced.)
