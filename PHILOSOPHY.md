## design philosophy

#### experimentation is necessary

David Ploog (a former DCSS developer) [wrote](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/03/23/making-dungeon-crawl-stone-soup-with-253-cooks-and-no-head-chef/): 
> In NetHack they have this model where if somebody [on the team] objects to something, it will not happen. So every person can veto every change. And in the end you could see that NetHack was dead, much less from having no releases – even when they had a few releases the changes that would appear were miniscule. Minor and minor. And they did improve, but they wouldn’t do anything radical. I was very much afraid that in Crawl, something like this could happen.

When I started bcrawl, I felt that DCSS had become stagnant, generally [unwilling](https://www.reddit.com/r/dcss/comments/9aseh1/has_dcss_development_stagnated/e4yty2n/) to try adding new content.

I agree with David Ploog's position, but I also believe that it's important to have:
- discussion of and collaboration on design of gameplay changes
- adequate testing before gameplay changes are made
- willingness to revert gameplay changes that don't improve the game

#### supporting more gameplay styles is good

Having more ways to play a game is good, if they are fun for at least some players and reasonably well-balanced. Variety provides both more replay value and wider appeal.

So, bcrawl will not be [changed](https://www.reddit.com/r/dcss/comments/8poib2/make_lees_rapid_deconstruction_never_break_walls/) to prevent strategies *just* because they violate developer preconceptions about how to play. Instead, the strength and entertainment values of tactics and strategies will be evaluated as they exist in practice.

Also, optional content such as species and usable items will generally only be removed if it is unfair, redundant, misleading, or useless. Content will not be removed just for being unnecessary to certain "canonical" strategies. Highly situational unusual tactics should be encouraged, and if novel and entertaining but suboptimal strategies are found, it's better to strengthen them than to remove them as options.

#### design ideology should be tested

Changes should be evaluated based on their effect in practice, not based on what they "should" do according to some design ideology.

#### games have many goals

According to the philosophy bcrawl follows, strategic depth, minimizing tedium, variety, replayability, flavor, narrative, intuitiveness, and visuals all have some value in games, and should all be balanced against each other.

Some designers follow an ideology that ignores some of those, or values one infinitely more than the others, but I believe that leads to games that are incomplete and unbalanced.
